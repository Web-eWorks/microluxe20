## Designer's Notes

### Setting the DC

The Difficulty Class can vary depending on how the player approaches the task. When setting the DC, think in terms of "What would Bob do?" - Bob being an imaginary 1st level commoner with no modifiers. Bob has straight 10s for all stats and no skill bonuses. He's the unheroic man on the street, and the benchmark by which heroes are measured.

In general, I recommend using only four DCs, especially at low levels:

| DC | Level |
| :--- | :--- |
| 10 | Easy – 50/50 chance of Bob succeeding 1st time |
| 15 | Moderate – would succeed after several attempts |
| 20 | Difficult – would succeed only with luck on his side |
| 25 | Very Difficult – Bob needs some hefty modifiers and the Titans watching over him |

Never use DC 5. If it's that easy and out of combat, keep the game flowing by having the players succeed automatically. Also, it helps if there's always an easy way to solve a problem. While each character can find at least one solution to a problem and gain the benefit of their highest attribute, there's usually a path of least resistance to be found. All the players have to do is discover it!

At higher levels, encourage the players to come up with ever more heroic solutions to problems. While a barred door might be a pause for thought to 1st level characters, by 10th level it's an excuse for light relief. Your 10th level Fighter would have a +13 Phys and most likely automatically succeed at any DC15 Phys+STR checks – so encourage them to aim for DC20, at least.

### Modifiers and More

Modifiers are the GM's Best Friend. Even a plus or minus 2 can make a world of difference, especially at lower levels. If your Human Rogue is trying to persuade the City Guard to let them enter the Merchant's Quarter after dark (Comm+MIND, DC15), grant them a +2 because the guard recently won at dice and is in a good mood. Alternatively, give them a minus 2 because he lost but drop hints as to the guard's weakness.

If the characters need to find a path through the Deadlands (Know+MIND, DC20) then finding an old trail map (a +4 modifier!) might just save them from becoming zombified minions of a powerful Lich!

Encourage the players to work for those modifiers, and reward them for clever, creative thinking. It's what the game is all about, after all.

### Fewer Skills Means More Choice

Back in the days of Classic D&D, players could do anything. With no straight-jacketed skill system to limit their choices, the players invented cool and clever solutions to problems. When faced with a 30ft. high statue with rubies for eyes, they erected pulleys to lift and swing the rogue into place far above their heads. Try doing that in 3rd Edition D&D and the GM will be left scratching their head. The D&D skill system has become a list of what the characters can do, silently eliminating all other possibilities, and that's no fun.

Microluxe20 is the best of both worlds; rather than provide a skills list, it provides a skills framework. This gives the players room to think of solutions rather than looking down a long list of skills to see what's most applicable to the task in hand.

Here's another example: Climbing. In D&D, that's a skill modified by STR. That's good if you're a Fighter, but not so good if you're a Wizard. In Microluxe20, the character could use Phys+STR ("I pull myself up"), Phys+DEX ("I nimbly climb the cliff face"), Phys+MIND ("I take my time, working out the best route and carefully testing each handhold") or even Guile+STR ("I climb, quietly"). That adds much more flavor to the game and encourages each player to find their own, unique, solution.

### When in Doubt... Remember

Whenever the players want to try something that goes around, through, or above and beyond the rules as written, you can always use the "GM's Friend"...the 50% chance.

Have them roll whatever check seems most appropriate. A roll of 1-10 is a failure, a roll of 11-20 is a success. If you feel that the situation warrants that you favor them, assign a +2 bonus to their roll. If the situation requires that they be hindered, then assign a –2 penalty.

### Using Existing D&D Monsters

So what happens when you're running a published adventure, or using a Monster from the Monster Manual or SRD?

Simple; use them as is. It doesn't matter that the Orc makes a Listen check to see if it detects the PCs, or if the NPC fails a Spot check. The mechanics are the same (roll d20+modifiers against a DC), and the emphasis should always be on simplicity and speed of play. There's no need to convert any monsters or NPCs to Microluxe20 before you use them. Just roll, and have fun!

### Using SRD Skills

To help with SRD conversions (and to help give some further stat + skill examples), here is a chart for the skills from the d20 SRD and their Microluxe20 equivalents:

## Microluxe20 Monster Building

Monster Building under Microluxe20 is so fast, it's possible to do it **on the fly** , right at the game table. And I'm going to show you how, using a Ninja Monkey as an example.

First, let's start by setting the Hit Dice for our Ninja Monkeys. As these are tiny little monkeys, fighting 1st level PCs, let's give them 1HD. _Quick tip: to speed monster creation further, multiply the Hit Dice by 5 for hit points; multiply Hit Dice by 7 for Dragons and Undead._

Remember that unlike Player Characters, Monsters and other NPCs **don't** add their STR total to their hit points. This is a special bonus for Real Heroes only. If you want a tougher Monster, increase their STR so they get an increase (equal to their STR bonus) to their HP per Hit Dice.

That gives the Ninja Monkeys 1HD, 5HP, +1 to hit with their Katana and +1 with all skills. As these are intelligent Ninjas, we'll allocate their +3 to Guile. Let's give them STR 0, DEX 4 and MIND 2, allow them to use DEX (rather than STR) for their attack roll with their miniature Katanas, which do d6 damage. Factoring that in with the Hit Dice, we get:

Ninja Monkey, 1HD (3HP), AC12, +3 Katana (1d6-2)
Guile+4, all others @ +1
STR 0, DEX 4, MIND 2

DONE! If the Ninja Monkeys have any special abilities or equipment, note them down but don't bother with setting uses/day, etc; if it's dramatically appropriate for a monster to use its abilities then use them. If you want a more powerful Ninja Monkey, just add Hit Dice, which increases HP, attack bonus and skills. Adjust Stats if it's logical to do so.

# Monster List

Any monster from just about any tabletop RPG may be used. The following list helps simplify SRD monsters for use in Microluxe20.

**Skills:** All creatures have a bonus to all skills (_Physical, Guile, Knowledge and Communication_) equal to their number of Hit Dice. If the creature is intelligent, add +3 to one skill. Add stat bonuses to suit and as logic dictates. This is intentionally kept open – if you need a sneaky bugbear, assign the +3 bonus to Guile; if a warrior, give +3 to Physical; for a spell-caster assign the +3 to Knowledge or Communication and give levels of Mage or Cleric (see below).

**Hit Die & Monster Advancement:** Hit Dice (HD) determine the toughness of a monster. The parenthetical HP is the average HP from the Hit Dice. To make a tougher monster, add more Hit Dice or add a numbered bonus to the Hit Dice; each additional Hit Die adds one to their skill and combat bonuses. For each doubling of the Hit Dice, increase the dice size for attacks (ex: d4- >d6, d6->d8, etc).

Alternatively, add class levels to intelligent monsters. Start with the base Hit Dice and add levels of Fighter, Rogue, Mage, Cleric, or other class as required.

**Create Your Own:** Assign Hit Dice (d8 for most things, d12 for Dragons and Undead). Attack bonus and skill level = number of Hit Dice. If it's an intelligent critter, add a +3 bonus to one skill. Add stat bonuses to suit.

## Disease

Diseases have various symptoms and are spread through a number of ways. Several typical diseases are summarized below. The entries for diseases include the following information:

- **Type** lists the disease's method of delivery (contact, inhaled, or injury).
- **Save DC** lists the phys+STR check DC needed to prevent infection.
- **Incubation** lists the time before damage begins.
- **Damage** lists the ability damage the character takes after incubation and each day afterward.

<!-- $data gm-damage.yml diseases -->

## Extreme Heat & Cold

If not wearing suitable protection, a character must make a Phys + STR check once every 10 minutes (DC 15, +1 per previous check), taking 1d6 damage on each failed save.

## Falling Damage

A falling character takes 1d6 HP of damage per 10 feet fallen. If the character makes a successful Phys + DEX roll, he/she takes only half damage. The DC for the Phys + DEX roll is equal to the depth fallen in feet.

In the event that the fall ends in an area laden with spikes or jagged rocks, add +1 HP of damage to falling damage per 10 feet fallen (with a maximum of +10 HP).

<h2 class="page-break">Poison</h2>

Characters can possibly take damage from a weapon that has been poisoned, be attacked by a creature whose natural attacks feature poison, consume poison hidden in food or drink, or be poisoned in some other way.

Several typical poisons are summarized below. The entries for poisons include the following information:

- **Type:** lists the poison's method of delivery (contact, ingested, inhaled, or injury).
- **DC:** lists the phys+STR check DC needed to avoid the poison's damage.
- **Damage:** is expressed as "xdx/xdx." The first number is the initial damage, taken immediately upon failing the Phys + STR check against the poison. The second number is the secondary damage, taken one minute after exposure to the poison if a second Phys + STR check is failed. Ability damage is temporary unless marked with an asterisk(\*), in which case the loss is permanent. Unconsciousness lasts 1d3 hours.
- **Price:** lists the cost for one dose of the poison. It can usually only be obtained through less-than-reputable sources, as the possession of poisons are commonly illegal.

<!-- $data gm-damage.yml poisons -->

<h2 class="page-break">Traps</h2>

Whether inside a dungeon or a nobleman's manor house, adventurers can often be hurt, or even killed, without ever encountering a monster of any kind, as many dungeons are filled with debilitating or lethal traps set to keep wayward hands off of fantastic treasures. Several typical traps of varying XP levels are summarized below.

The entries for traps include the following information:

- **Name:** lists the trap used and the effect it has.
- **XP:** lists the XP the party gains for successfully discovering and disarming the trap.
- **Save DC:** lists the DC for the Phys + DEX check needed to either avoid the trap entirely, or to take only ½ the listed damage.
- **Search DC:** lists the DC for the Know + MIND check necessary to find the trap without triggering it.
- **Disable DC:** lists the DC for the Guile + DEX check necessary to disarm the trap safely.
- **Attack:** shows the traps attack bonus or type of effect, and the damage the trap deals.
