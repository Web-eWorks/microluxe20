## Starting Wealth

The most common coin is the _gold piece_ (gp).

## Weapons

Some weapons use ammunition, which is consumed at a rate of 1 for every attack made, regardless of the success. When a weapon is out of ammunition, you must spend a round reloading it before you are able to fire it again.

Some weapons (such as grenades) are thrown at the enemy and then do damage; to resolve these, the character makes a skill check to throw the weapon (usually DEX+Accuracy) and the location of the weapon is determined by the Gamemaster, then attacks are rolled for each character caught in the weapon's attack radius. A weapon's attack roll is 1d20 + the weapon's attack bonus. For all attacks that succeed, damage is resolved normally.

Here is the format for weapon entries (given as column headings on the table below):

- **Damage:** The damage column gives the damage dealt by the weapon on a successful hit.
- **Range:** Any attack less than this distance is not penalized. However, every extra 5ft. imposes a -2 penalty on the attack roll.
- **Complexity:** Different weapons require different amount of training to use. The level of complexity relies on the player's class. For example, Mages cannot use Complex weapons.
- **Cost:** This value is the price for purchasing the weapon. The cost includes miscellaneous gear that goes with the weapon (For example, buying a bow would include a quiver as well).

## Armor & Shields

Here is the format for armor entries (given as column headings on the table below):

- **Size:** The physical size of the armor. Different classes can only wear specific sizes of armor. Similar to armor sizes, different types of shields are only available to certain classes as well.
- **Cost:** The normal price of the armor.
- **AC Bonus:** The Armor Class bonus provided by the armor when worn.
