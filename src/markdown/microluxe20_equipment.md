# Equipment

When you create a character, you start with nothing but the clothes on your back and some gold in your pocket. Depending upon the setting and adventure your Gamemaster is running, you may have the opportunity to purchase some items before beginning play, or the Gamemaster may allow you to do your shopping in the game world.

These tables list a number of items, their stats, and prices for Gamemasters to populate their shops and worlds and loot tables. The availabilty of items in these tables is at the Gamemaster's discretion â€“ just because it's on the list doesn't mean you can buy it at just any shop in the world.

## Starting Wealth

The most common coin used on Terador is the _gold piece_ (gp). The gold piece can be converted into other coins:

You begin with a certain amount of acquired wealth, determined by your character class.

## Weapons

Here is the format for weapon entries (given as column headings on the table below):

- **Cost:** This value is the price for purchasing the weapon. The cost includes miscellaneous gear that goes with the weapon (For example, buying a bow would include a quiver as well).
- **Damage:** The damage column gives the damage dealt by the weapon on a successful hit.
- **Range:** Any attack less than this distance is not penalized. However, every extra 5ft. imposes a -2 penalty on the attack roll.
- **Complexity:** Different weapons require different amount of training to use. The level of complexity relies on the player's class. For example, Mages cannot use Complex weapons.
