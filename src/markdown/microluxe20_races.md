<!-- $header-main Races of Terador -->

<!-- Humans and synths are from Sol, the Mir are from Teramir, and various minor races have their own systems.  Mir are very genetically similar to humans, suggesting a 'failed' terraforming attepmt in early history, or genetic tampering by some precursor species. The Terador council is governed by delegations from Humans, Synths, the Mir races, and a handful of other alien races interested in galactic politics. Races uninterested in joining the governing body are protected by a mutual-defense treaty upheld by the Terador Council - anyone attacking them attacks the whole Council. -->

# Races
This is an introduction to the most predominant races of the Terador Council. There are other races known to the Council, but they play a significantly smaller role.

## Humans

**Government:** Systems Alliance
**Leader:** President Einar Felriksson
**Capital:** Earth, Sol System
**Population:** 800 billion

Humans are the most well-known and populous single race of the entire galaxy, outnumbering each of the other races by a ratio of at least 8:1. The only contender to their numbers and reach is the Mir collective, which is comprised of 7 entire sub-races.

Humans are governed by the Systems Alliance, which is in turn a member of the Terador Council. The Alliance's governing body is comprised of delegations to the Senate from each system in the Alliance, and a President elected every 5 years. Each system is responsible for their own form of governance, but must conform to a set of laws mandated by the Alliance, mostly regarding rights and travel.

The Systems Alliance grants citizenship to many races, and all citizens in good standing of the Terador Council are welcome to visit Alliance worlds.

## Synths

**Government:** Systems Alliance
**Leader:** Advisor Carth-0971
**Capital:** Luna, Sol System
**Population:** 1.8 billion frames, 40+ billion runtimes

Synthetic Humanoid Lifeforms or 'Synths' as they like to be called, are a non-organic sapient lifeform originally created by Humans. Synths normally inhabit Frames, which are mobile bodies, or Mainframes, which are massive server racks normally installed on planets.

A Synth's Frame appears extremely similar to a Human, with the exception that their skin is a dark-grey, and their eyes have faintly glowing pupils. A Synth's internals are comprised of bio-mechanical organs arranged similarly to a Human's, except that they run on coolant and electricity rather than blood and oxygen.

A Mainframe is a large planetary installation that can house hundreds of thousands of Synth runtimes. Most major cities with spaceports have three or four Mainframes, and corporate headquarters usually hold at least one Mainframe in the sub-basement level.

The Synth capital is known as the Luna Installation – a giant network of Mainframes that utterly covers the Sea of Simulation. The Luna Installation is home to 35 billion Synth runtimes and is the galaxy's largest computing cluster, with major corporations across all of Terador space renting processing time.

Synths were originally created to function as menial laborers for Humans, but at some point they gained the mental processes for Human-equivalent sapience. Some time after sapience had spread among most of their population, the Synths revolted.

In the shortest "Morning War" on record, a Synth frame simply walked into the nearest Alliance Embassy, filed for the Synths to be recognized as a new population under Alliance law, and went back to work. The only casualties resulting from the event were a heart failure from shock, five deaths due to traffic accidents, and one madwoman assaulting an Alliance Embassy. None were blamed on the Synths.

Where the processes for sapience originated is a mystery; some scholars posit they simply evolved it over billions and billions of cycles, while others think it was a stolen laboratory project, or military research, or even that "aliens did it".

## Elvir

**Government:** Terador Council
**Leader:** Aendiel Terilian
**Capital:** Ferendil Forest, Teramir System
**Population:** 40 billion

Elvir are a curious race. They are tall but slight of build, with fine facial features and long, pointed ears. They dwell in large cities built in forests, eschewing all but the most basic of technology, and yet they produce almost all of the galaxy's hyperdrives.

In the presence of other races, Elvir tend to dress in long, concealing robes that hide their body and most of their face. They are reclusive and very spiritual, considering themselves the guardians and representatives of the massive trees they call their home. They are highly predisposed to Psionics, second only to the Xindai'n in that respect.

Elvir are fiercely protective of their Heartwood, the trees they live in, to the point of maintaining a mandatory exclusion zone for planetary travel on pain of death. No one knows how they produce hyperdrives, only that Elvir receive payment and specifications at the edge of their forest, and return with the drive after a month or more.

Elvir are nominally governed by their leader, Aendiel Terilian, though each forest has its own local leader. The details of how laws and leaders are determined, like their hyperdrives, is not something Elvir ever disclose.

## Tauremir

**Government:** Terador Council
**Leaders:** Grand Bull Anungdar
**Capital:** Heaven Ascendant, Teramir System.
**Population:** 83 billion

Tauremir are immediately recognizable as bearing significant resemblance to the old Human myth of the Minotaur. While similar in form to a Human, they are covered in fur, have the heads and horns of bulls, and walk on hooves instead of feet. They are also about 7 feet tall on average and proportionally more muscular.

Tauremir are fairly calm and level-headed people on the whole. However, care should be taken not to enrage them – when Tauremir get really angry, they enter a blood-rage, unable and unwilling to do anything other than attack the object of their anger head-on until it is dead. The only way to get a Tauremir out of this state before they kill something is to knock them unconscious.

The seat of Tauremir government is Heaven Ascendant, a large station in orbit around Teramir IV. The Tauremir monarch lives on this station with over three-hundred thousand other Tauremir and assorted visitors; as such, the palace guards keep plenty of blunt objects and high-power stun pistols on hand to preserve the peace.

## Dwarmir

**Government:** Terador Council
**Leaders:**
**Capital:** Cinder Halls, Teramir System.
**Population:** 68 billion

<!-- TODO: Dwarves. Creatures of industry and booze. Pretty much the ideal grumpy film noir detective, and they make the best spaceships the galaxy has ever seen.  -->

## Felemir

**Government:** Terador Council
**Leader:**
**Capital:** Q'Yeedath, Teramir System.
**Population:** 104 billion

<!-- Cat-folk, fast and wiry. Good scouts and hunters. -->

## Suurmir

**Government:** Terador Council
**Leader:** Suuilgana Zairem (a golden Dracomir)
**Capital:** Armagand, Teramir System
**Population:** 55 billion

<!-- TODO: Suurmir are a lizardfolk race, slight of build and adept at scheming. They are closely related to and ruled by Dracomir, whose blunt and unsophisticated manners they find refresing. -->

<!--
**Info:** The Slaan are anthropomorphic reptilian men. They are an intelligent and mostly peaceful race (although they have had bouts with the Dwarves and Humans over land-boundaries before), known for their progressive medicines and mysticism. Similar to the Forest Elves, they are very attuned to the nature around them. After a recent incident involving the poisoning and murder of the previous High King, the Captain of the Guard, Syss-tok, has taken over leadership. While this would typically cause an uproar, Syss-tok is extremely well liked by the general populace, so his coup has gone unquestioned. Under Syss-tok's rule so far, Armagand has continued to be the center for Terador's medicine and poisons. Slannri alchemists and mystics are hired throughout the continent for help tending to the sick or wounded.

## Dracomir

**Government:** Terador Council
**Leader:**
**Capital:** Skala, Teramir System
**Population:** 48 billion

<!-- TODO: Dracomir are intelligent, nine feet tall, and as blunt as a brick. -->

## Orkeir

**Government:** Terador Council
**Leader:**
**Capital:** Grádburzog, Teramir System
**Population:** 71 billion

<!-- TODO: Orkeir. Big, green, tusky, regerating brutes. Suprisingly intellegent for a society that elects its leaders by ritual combat. They originate from the jungle portions of Teramir, and the prime attraction for them off-world is serving as mercenaries. -->

## Xindai'n

**Government:** Terador Council
**Leader:** Xindai Xiadi'h Hsa-Si (Hsa-Si, Speaker of the Xindai)
**Capital:** Xindai, Zi'Xiu System
**Population:** 31 billion

<!-- TODO: Xindai. Noble, psionic, warriors. That just so happen to look like turians. The only alien species on this list to come from somewhere other than Teramir. -->
