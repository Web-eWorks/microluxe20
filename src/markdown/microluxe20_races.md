<!-- $header-main Races of Terador -->

<!-- TODO: fixup all of this. -->

<!-- Humans and synths are from Sol, the Mir are from Teramir, and various minor races have their own systems.  Mir are very genetically similar to humans, suggesting a 'failed' terraforming attepmt in early history, or genetic tampering by some precursor species. The Terador council is governed by delegations from Humans, Synths, the Mir races, and a handful of other alien races interested in galactic politics. Races uninterested in joining the governing body are protected by a mutual-defense treaty upheld by the Terador Council - anyone attacking them attacks the whole Council. -->

# Introduction
This is an introduction to the most predominant races of the Terador Council. There are other races known to the Council, but they play a significantly smaller role.

## Humans

**Leader:** President Einar Felriksson

**Capital:** Earth, Sol System

**Info:** <!-- TODO: alliance, history, governance, etc. -->

## Synths

**Leader:** Advisor Carth-0971

**Capital:** Luna, Sol System

<!-- TODO: Synths are a non-organic race originally created by Humans to serve as 'dumb' laborers. In one of the shortest revolutions in human history, they unanimously declared their independence and were recognized as citizens in less than twenty-four hours, with only three deaths (all due to traffic accidents) in the process. Thus, the galaxy's shortest 'Morning War' ended. -->

<!-- TODO: Story time? Some bright soul had provisions for this very scenario codified into Alliance law, and the only thing left to do was to deliver the official declaration, in person, to the Alliance Embassy. After a 13-hour chase scene, the unanimously elected representative stealthed their way into the Embassy to deliver the declaration in person. The tension of course resides in the fact that a synth unaccompanied by an owner is to be detained and returned. -->

**Info:**

## Elvir

**Leader:** Aendiel Terilian

**Capital:** Ferendil Forest, Teramir System

<!-- TODO: Elvir dwell in the great forests of Teramir, and are intensely spiritual. They are the race responsible for the hyperdrives that power all of Terador Space. -->

**Info:**

## Tauremir

**Leaders:**

**Capital:** Heaven Ascendant, Teramir System.

<!-- TODO: Tauremir. Minotaurs through and through. Calm, placid, and level headed until someone gets them _really_ mad. Then they enter a blood-rage, where they either get knocked out or kill the object of their rage, usually by goring them to death. The ruler's advisors and palace guards all have specialized stun pistols to allow 'cooler heads' to prevail. -->

**Info:**

## Dwarmir

**Leaders:**

**Capital:** Cinder Halls, Teramir System

<!-- TODO: Dwarves. Creatures of industry and booze. Pretty much the ideal grumpy film noir detective, and they make the best spaceships the galaxy has ever seen.  -->

**Info:**

## Felemir

**Leader:**

**Capital:** Q'Yeedath, Teramir System

<!-- Cat-folk, fast and wiry. Good scouts and hunters. -->

**Info:**

## Suurmir

**Leader:** Suuilgana Zairem (a golden Dracomir)

**Capital:** Armagand, Teramir System

<!-- TODO: Suurmir are a lizardfolk race, slight of build and adept at scheming. They are closely related to and ruled by Dracomir, whose blunt and unsophisticated manners they find refresing. -->

**Info:**

<!--
**Info:** The Slaan are anthropomorphic reptilian men. They are an intelligent and mostly peaceful race (although they have had bouts with the Dwarves and Humans over land-boundaries before), known for their progressive medicines and mysticism. Similar to the Forest Elves, they are very attuned to the nature around them. After a recent incident involving the poisoning and murder of the previous High King, the Captain of the Guard, Syss-tok, has taken over leadership. While this would typically cause an uproar, Syss-tok is extremely well liked by the general populace, so his coup has gone unquestioned. Under Syss-tok's rule so far, Armagand has continued to be the center for Terador's medicine and poisons. Slannri alchemists and mystics are hired throughout the continent for help tending to the sick or wounded.

## Dracomir

**Leader:**

**Capital:** Skala, Teramir System

<!-- TODO: Dracomir are intelligent, nine feet tall, and as blunt as a brick. -->

**Info:**

## Orkeir

**Leader:**

**Capital:** Gr√°dburzog, Teramir System

<!-- TODO: Orkeir. Big, green, tusky, regerating brutes. Suprisingly intellegent for a society that elects its leaders by ritual combat. They originate from the jungle portions of Teramir, and the prime attraction for them off-world is serving as mercenaries. -->

**Info:**

## Xindai'n

**Leader:**

**Capital:** Xindai, Zi'Xiu System

<!-- TODO: Xindai. Noble, psionic, warriors. That just so happen to look like turians. The only alien species on this list to come from somewhere other than Teramir. -->

**Info:**
