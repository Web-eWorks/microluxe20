{"name":"Microluxe20","tagline":"a slightly shortened and reworked version of the Microlite20 rules","body":"<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://github.com/kgrubb/microluxe20/blob/master/src/static/logo.png\" alt=\"Microluxe 20\">\r\n</p>\r\nMicroluxe20 attempts to be a stand-in replacement for any [SRD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Reference_Document) based tabletop adventure. The main goal is to utilize the simplicity of [Microlite20](http://microlite20.net/), while also adding various races, classes, and game-balancing tweaks. It also strives to clarify some of the more confusing parts of the Microlite20 system.\r\n\r\n## Handbook\r\nTo dive right into the game, check out the online handbook [here](https://github.com/kgrubb/microluxe20/blob/master/src/markdown/microluxe20_handbook.md)!\r\n\r\nMicroluxe20 comes with a pre-designed campaign setting, named \"Terador\". The lore/mythos can be found [here](https://github.com/kgrubb/microluxe20/blob/master/src/markdown/microluxe20_lore.md). A complete map can be found [here](https://github.com/kgrubb/microluxe20/blob/master/map/Terador-complete.png). If you are interested in reading about the available races of Terador, check out [this](https://github.com/kgrubb/microluxe20/blob/master/src/markdown/microluxe20_races.md).  Otherwise, feel free to use your own setting and races!\r\n\r\n## Downloads\r\nThe latest release can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/kgrubb/microluxe20/releases/latest)!\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\n**NOTICE:** OSX is currently not supported (or advised) for compiling the PDFs. This project's build process depends on gulp-markdown-pdf, which wraps markdown-pdf. When compiling the PDF files, the filesize of the PDF gets ridiculously huge. There is an open issue [here](https://github.com/alanshaw/markdown-pdf/issues/37), explaining that its an OSX-only PhantomJS issue, documented [here](https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/issues/10373).\r\n\r\nIf you want to contribute to the game's handbooks, please do the following:\r\n\r\n##### 1. Ensure you have Node and NPM installed\r\n\r\nNode and NPM are used to build the PDF documents. You can find a link to node [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).\r\n\r\n##### 2. Fork the repository and clone locally\r\n\r\nContributions follow github's pull request model. You can find more information on best practices [here](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).\r\n\r\n##### 3. npm install\r\n\r\nFirst, run:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nnpm install -g gulp\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will globally install gulp, which is used for building the PDFs.\r\nNext, run the following:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nnpm install\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will create a folder called node_modules, which will contain the dependencies used to build the PDFs.\r\n\r\n##### 4. Making changes and building PDFs\r\n\r\nMake changes to the __markdown__ files (found in the `src/markdown` directory). Once you have finished your changes, run the following command:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ngulp compile-markdown\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will create a new folder named `documents` that contains the finished PDFs.\r\n\r\nYou can also use the following command to automatically build PDFs whenever changes are saved to a markdown file:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ngulp watch-markdown\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### 5. Submit a pull request\r\n\r\nCommit your changes and submit a new pull request to the microluxe20 develop branch.\r\n\r\n## Authors & Contributors\r\n* Keli Grubb (<keligrubb324@gmail.com>)\r\n* Doug Rich\r\n\r\n## Licensing\r\nLicensed under the [Open Game License](LICENSE).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
