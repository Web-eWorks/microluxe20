Microluxe20 attempts to be a stand-in replacement for any [SRD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Reference_Document) based tabletop
adventure. The main goal is to utilize the simplicity of
[Microlite20](http://microlite20.net/), while also adding various races,
classes, and game-balancing tweaks. It also strives to clarify some of the more
confusing parts of the Microlite20 system.

## Handbook
To dive right into the game, check out the online handbook [here](md/microluxe20_complete.md)!

Microluxe20 comes with a pre-designed campaign setting, named "Terador". The
lore/mythos can be found [here](md/microluxe20_lore.md). If you are interested
in reading about the available races of Terador, check out
[this](md/microluxe20_races.md).  Otherwise, feel free to use your own setting
and races!

## Downloads
You can download the entire project [here](https://github.com/kgrubb/microluxe20/releases/latest)!
All of the necessary documents and supplements can be found in the `documents` directory.
