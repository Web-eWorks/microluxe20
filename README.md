Microluxe20 attempts to be a stand-in replacement for any [SRD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Reference_Document) based tabletop
adventure. The main goal is to bring in the simplicity of [Microlite20](http://microlite20.net/), but also
add various races and classes, as well as balance and clarify some of the more
confusing parts of the Microlite20 system.

## Handbook

of Terador, check [this](handbook/microluxe20_races.md) out. Otherwise, feel free to use your own setting and races!
